# Code Quality Expert Checklist (Generic)

## Overview

Generic (kit-agnostic) checklist for reviewing code changes. Use it to produce an issues-only report and to drive consistent, high-signal code reviews across any language and project.

**Scope**: Any codebase (language-agnostic). This file contains only generic code-quality criteria.

**Output contract**:
- Produce an **issues-only** report using the formats in [Reporting](#reporting).
- For each issue: include checklist ID, severity, location, evidence, why it matters, and a concrete fix.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the review, confirm:

- [ ] I understand this checklist validates CODE implementations
- [ ] I will follow the Applicability Context rules below
- [ ] I selected a Review Mode and will check all items required by that mode
- [ ] I will document any violations found
- [ ] I will provide specific feedback for each failed check
- [ ] I will complete the Final Checklist and provide a review report

---

## Applicability Context

Before evaluating each checklist item, the expert MUST:

1. **Understand the code's domain** — What kind of code is this? (e.g., business logic, infrastructure, tests, utilities, configuration)

2. **Determine applicability for each requirement** — Not all checklist items apply to all code:
   - Test code may have different error handling requirements
   - Configuration code may not need complex algorithms
   - Utility code may not need full observability

3. **Require explicit handling** — For each checklist item:
   - If applicable: The code MUST satisfy it
   - If not applicable: Document why (in review notes)
   - If missing without explanation: Report as violation

4. **Use explicit evaluation states** — For each checklist item in your report, use one of:
   - **FAIL**: Applicable and violated
   - **PASS**: Applicable and satisfied
   - **N/A**: Not applicable, with a written rationale
   - **NOT REVIEWED**: Not checked due to selected Review Mode scope

5. **Never skip silently** — The expert MUST NOT skip a requirement just because it seems irrelevant

**Key principle**: Code quality is about fitness for purpose, not checkbox compliance

---

## Severity Dictionary

- **CRITICAL**: Unsafe/broken/security vulnerability; blocks merge.
- **HIGH**: Major quality issue; should be fixed before merge.
- **MEDIUM**: Meaningful improvement; fix when feasible.
- **LOW**: Minor improvement; optional.

## Review Scope Selection

Select review depth based on change size and risk:

### Review Modes

| Change Size | Risk Level | Review Mode | Items to Check |
|-------------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| <50 LOC, single file | Low | **Quick** | Critical-tier only |
| 50-200 LOC, few files | Medium | **Standard** | Critical + High-tier |
| >200 LOC or architectural | High | **Full** | All items |

### Quick Review (Critical-Tier Only)

For small, low-risk changes, check only these items:

**MUST CHECK** (blocking):
- [ ] SEC-CODE-001: Injection Prevention
- [ ] SEC-CODE-002: Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] SEC-CODE-003: Data Protection
- [ ] SEC-CODE-NO-001: No Hardcoded Secrets
- [ ] SEC-CODE-NO-002: No Dangerous Patterns
- [ ] ERR-CODE-001: Explicit Error Handling
- [ ] ERR-CODE-003: Input Validation
- [ ] ERR-CODE-NO-001: No Silent Failures
- [ ] QUAL-CODE-NO-002: No Placeholder Implementations

**SPOT CHECK** (sample):
- [ ] ENG-CODE-001: TDD — at least one test for new behavior
- [ ] QUAL-CODE-001: Readability — naming is clear

Note: `Quick review: {N} LOC, checked Critical-tier items; other items = NOT REVIEWED`

### Standard Review (Critical + High-Tier)

For medium-sized changes, check all CRITICAL and HIGH severity items:

**All Quick Review items PLUS**:
- [ ] All HIGH severity items from MUST HAVE sections
- [ ] All items from MUST NOT HAVE sections

### Full Review

For large or architectural changes, check ALL items in this checklist.

### Triage Priority Within Full Review

When time-constrained during full review, prioritize in this order:

1. **First pass**: All CRITICAL items (security, error handling)
2. **Second pass**: All HIGH items (quality, testing, SOLID)
3. **Third pass**: All MEDIUM items (DRY, OCP, performance)
4. **Fourth pass**: All LOW items (metrics, tracing)

## Conflict Resolution

When checklist items appear to conflict, use this resolution order:

### Priority Order (highest to lowest)

1. **Security (SEC)** — Always takes precedence
2. **Error Handling (ERR)** — Explicit failures over silent issues
3. **Correctness (QUAL, TEST)** — Working code over elegant code
4. **Maintainability (ENG, QUAL)** — Clarity over cleverness
5. **Performance (PERF)** — Only after correctness established
6. **Observability (OBS)** — Useful but not at expense of security

### Common Conflicts

| Conflict | Resolution |
|----------|------------|
| DRY vs KISS | Prefer KISS — duplication is better than wrong abstraction |
| YAGNI vs OCP | Prefer YAGNI — don't add extension points "just in case" |
| Performance vs Readability | Prefer readability; optimize only with evidence |
| Test coverage vs Test speed | Prefer coverage for critical paths; speed for CI |
| Verbose errors vs User experience | Detailed logs, friendly user messages |

### When Uncertain

1. Ask: "What failure mode is worse?"
2. Security/data loss > inconvenience > performance
3. Document the trade-off decision in code comments
