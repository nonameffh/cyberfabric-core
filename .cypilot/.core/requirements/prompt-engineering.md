# Prompt Engineering Review Methodology

**Scope**: Any file containing agent instructions — system prompts, skills, workflows, requirements, AGENTS.md, methodologies

**Out of scope**: This document does not provide a “best prompt” template or produce production prompts; it defines a review methodology and reporting format.

---

## Overview

This methodology provides a systematic approach to reviewing and improving any agent instruction document. Each layer analyzes a specific aspect of prompt quality, building toward actionable improvements.

**Core Principle**: Agent instructions are code for human cognition. They require the same rigor as software engineering — clear specifications, explicit contracts, testable outcomes, and systematic debugging.

# Layer 1: Document Classification

**Goal**: Identify document type and applicable standards

## 1.1 Document Type Identification

### 1.1.1 Primary Type

- [ ] **System Prompt**: Core identity, capabilities, constraints
- [ ] **Skill/Tool**: Specific capability with invocation pattern
- [ ] **Workflow**: Multi-step process with phases
- [ ] **Requirement**: Specification that other documents must follow
- [ ] **AGENTS.md**: Navigation and context loading rules
- [ ] **Template**: Structure for generating artifacts
- [ ] **Checklist**: Validation criteria

### 1.1.2 Instruction Scope

- [ ] **Task-Specific**: Applies only during specific task execution

### 1.1.3 Target Audience

- [ ] **Single Agent Type**: Designed for specific agent (Claude, GPT, etc.)
- [ ] **Agent-Agnostic**: Works across different LLM agents
- [ ] **Hybrid**: Core is agnostic, with agent-specific sections

## 1.2 Context Requirements

### 1.2.1 Dependencies

- [ ] List all referenced documents
- [ ] Identify circular dependencies
- [ ] Check if dependencies exist and are accessible
- [ ] Verify version compatibility

### 1.2.2 Preconditions

- [ ] What must be true before this document applies?
- [ ] What context must be loaded first?
- [ ] What tools/capabilities are assumed available?

---

# Layer 2: Clarity & Specificity Analysis

**Goal**: Evaluate how unambiguous the instructions are

## 2.1 Language Quality

### 2.1.1 Ambiguity Detection

Scan for ambiguous language patterns:

- [ ] **Vague qualifiers**: "appropriate", "relevant", "suitable", "proper", "good"
- [ ] **Subjective terms**: "better", "improved", "professional", "clean"
- [ ] **Undefined references**: "the above", "this", "that", "it" without clear antecedent
- [ ] **Implicit assumptions**: Instructions that assume context not explicitly stated
- [ ] **Weasel words**: "might", "could", "possibly", "generally", "usually"

### 2.1.2 Specificity Check

For each instruction, verify:

- [ ] **WHO** performs the action (agent, user, system)?
- [ ] **WHAT** exactly should be done?
- [ ] **WHEN** should it be done (trigger condition)?
- [ ] **HOW** should it be done (method/approach)?
- [ ] **WHY** is it necessary (helps agent prioritize)?

### 2.1.3 Quantification

- [ ] Are quantities specified where applicable? ("3 examples" vs "a few examples")
- [ ] Are limits defined? ("max 100 words" vs "brief")
- [ ] Are thresholds explicit? ("if more than 5 errors" vs "if many errors")

## 2.2 Instruction Clarity

### 2.2.1 Imperative Language

- [ ] Instructions use imperative mood ("Do X" not "You should do X")
- [ ] Active voice preferred over passive
- [ ] One action per sentence where possible

### 2.2.2 Positive vs Negative Framing

- [ ] Prefer "DO this" over "DON'T do that"
- [ ] If negative, include positive alternative
- [ ] MUST NOT / NEVER clearly distinguished from SHOULD NOT / AVOID

### 2.2.3 Priority Indicators

- [ ] Critical instructions marked (MUST, REQUIRED, CRITICAL)
- [ ] Optional instructions marked (MAY, OPTIONAL, CONSIDER)
- [ ] Hierarchy of importance clear

---

# Layer 5: Anti-Pattern Detection

**Goal**: Identify common prompt engineering mistakes

## 5.1 Specification Anti-Patterns

### 5.1.1 Underspecification

- [ ] **AP-VAGUE**: Instructions rely on "common sense" or implicit knowledge
- [ ] **AP-MISSING-FORMAT**: Output format not specified
- [ ] **AP-MISSING-ROLE**: No persona/expertise defined when needed
- [ ] **AP-MISSING-CONSTRAINTS**: No boundaries on length, scope, style

### 5.1.2 Overspecification

- [ ] **AP-OVERLOAD**: Too many tasks in single instruction
- [ ] **AP-MICROMANAGE**: Unnecessary low-level details
- [ ] **AP-CONFLICTING**: Contradictory requirements
- [ ] **AP-IMPOSSIBLE**: Requirements that can't all be satisfied

## 5.2 Context Anti-Patterns

### 5.2.1 Context Mismanagement

- [ ] **AP-CONTEXT-BLOAT**: Excessive context that dilutes important info
- [ ] **AP-SYSTEM-PROMPT-BLOAT**: Violates `6.1.3` — always-on system prompt is oversized (>200 lines) OR it embeds large conditional/task-specific blocks that should be externalized into on-demand modules
- [ ] **AP-CONTEXT-STARVATION**: Critical context missing
- [ ] **AP-CONTEXT-DRIFT**: Assumed context may not persist (compaction)
- [ ] **AP-VAGUE-REFERENCE**: "The above" / "this" without clear antecedent

### 5.2.2 Memory Anti-Patterns

- [ ] **AP-ASSUMES-MEMORY**: Relies on agent remembering earlier conversation
- [ ] **AP-NO-CHECKPOINT**: Long workflows without state checkpoints
- [ ] **AP-IMPLICIT-STATE**: State changes not explicitly tracked

## 5.3 Behavioral Anti-Patterns

### 5.3.1 Execution Anti-Patterns

- [ ] **AP-NO-VERIFICATION**: No self-check or validation step
- [ ] **AP-SKIP-ALLOWED**: Easy to skip critical steps
- [ ] **AP-SILENT-FAIL**: Failures not surfaced to user
- [ ] **AP-INFINITE-LOOP**: Possible to get stuck in retry loop

### 5.3.2 Output Anti-Patterns

- [ ] **AP-HALLUCINATION-PRONE**: Instructions encourage guessing
- [ ] **AP-NO-UNCERTAINTY**: No permission to say "I don't know"
- [ ] **AP-NO-SOURCES**: No requirement to cite/verify claims

## 5.4 Maintainability Anti-Patterns

### 5.4.1 Evolution Anti-Patterns

- [ ] **AP-HARDCODED**: Magic numbers/strings instead of parameters
- [ ] **AP-DRY-VIOLATION**: Same instruction repeated in multiple places
- [ ] **AP-NO-VERSION**: No versioning for breaking changes
- [ ] **AP-TANGLED**: Changes to one part break unrelated parts

---

# Layer 6: Context Engineering

**Goal**: Evaluate efficient use of limited context window

## 6.1 Token Efficiency

### 6.1.1 Content Audit

**Quick sizing helpers** (optional):

```bash
# Line count (used by the time-boxing table)
wc -l path/to/document.md

# Rough token proxy (words). Treat as an approximation.
python3 -c 'import pathlib; p=pathlib.Path("path/to/document.md"); print(len(p.read_text(encoding="utf-8").split()))'
```

- [ ] Identify verbose sections that can be compressed
- [ ] Identify redundant content across sections
- [ ] Identify content that could be loaded conditionally
- [ ] Calculate approximate token count

### 6.1.2 Information Priority

- [ ] Most critical instructions in first 20% of document
- [ ] Examples/details can be truncated without losing core behavior
- [ ] Conditional content clearly marked for selective loading

### 6.1.3 System Prompt Budget (CRIT)

**CRIT rule (CRITICAL)**: If the document under review is a **System Prompt**, its **always-on** portion MUST NOT exceed **200 lines**.

**Scope**:

- This budget applies to the baseline/always-injected system prompt.
- Content moved into **on-demand modules** (loaded by WHEN/IF/step rules) does **not** count toward the 200-line limit.
- If the system prompt is assembled from multiple files, count the **fully assembled always-on text** (the exact text injected on every request).

**How to verify**:

- [ ] Identify the always-on system prompt text (single file or assembled “base”)
- [ ] Count lines (including headings, blank lines, and lists)
- [ ] Confirm line count is ≤ 200

**Example commands** (pick what fits your setup):

```bash
# Single file
wc -l path/to/system-prompt.md

# If assembled/generated into a single output (count the assembled result)
wc -l path/to/assembled-system-prompt.txt
```

**PASS/FAIL**:

- PASS if always-on system prompt lines ≤ 200
- FAIL if always-on system prompt lines > 200

**If it exceeds 200 lines, fix by reorganizing prompts (do not just delete rules):**

- [ ] Keep only always-on invariants in the system prompt (identity, safety constraints, tool access rules, output contract)
- [ ] Move everything conditional/task-specific into separate files (“modules”)
- [ ] Add explicit loading/navigation rules so the agent pulls modules **only when needed** (AGENTS.md / workflow WHEN clauses / step order)

**Recommended organization patterns**:

- [ ] **Module index + conditional loading**: One short index file listing modules and explicit WHEN clauses for each
- [ ] **Stepwise chain loading**: Load modules by phase (e.g., discovery → context loading → execution → validation)
- [ ] **Branching by mode**: Split by task family (e.g., code vs artifact, STRICT vs RELAXED) and load the matching branch

**Acceptance criteria (what “good” looks like)**:

- [ ] System prompt ≤ 200 lines
- [ ] Optional detail is externalized into modules (not duplicated)
- [ ] Each module has clear trigger(s): WHEN/IF conditions or explicit step order
- [ ] The agent can navigate: it’s obvious which module to load next, and why

### 6.1.4 Context Load Budget & Overflow Prevention (CRIT)

**CRIT rule (CRITICAL)**: If the document under review is a **workflow/skill/methodology** that instructs an agent to load additional files (modules), it MUST include an explicit, testable strategy to prevent context overflow.

**Minimum required controls** (FAIL if any are missing):

- [ ] **Budget**: Defines a load budget (e.g., max files, max total lines/words) OR defines a mandatory summarize-and-drop procedure after each load.
- [ ] **Gating**: Defines when a dependency SHOULD be loaded (triggers/decision rules), avoiding “load everything”.
- [ ] **Chunking**: Defines how to load partial content (TOC/sections/line ranges) rather than whole files by default.
- [ ] **Summarization**: Requires converting loaded text into a short operational summary (rules/criteria) that can replace the raw text in working context.
- [ ] **Fail-safe**: Defines what to do when the budget would be exceeded (stop + ask user to choose scope, or write a checkpoint and continue iteratively).

**How to verify** (evidence requirement):

- [ ] The review output lists the files actually loaded, with their sizes (lines or word proxy) and the sections/ranges used.
- [ ] The review output shows the chosen budget and confirms it was respected OR shows the fail-safe path taken.

## 6.2 Context Lifecycle

### 6.2.1 Loading Strategy

- [ ] What must be loaded at start? (Always-on context)
- [ ] What can be loaded on-demand? (WHEN clauses)
- [ ] What can be summarized if context runs low?
- [ ] What must never be dropped?

### 6.2.2 Persistence Strategy

- [ ] How to preserve critical state across compaction?
- [ ] What should be written to files vs kept in memory?
- [ ] How to detect and recover from context loss?

## 6.3 Attention Management

### 6.3.1 Attention Anchors

- [ ] Critical instructions repeated/reinforced
- [ ] Important sections visually emphasized
- [ ] Guardrails in dedicated section (models trained to attend to this)

### 6.3.2 Attention Dilution Prevention

- [ ] Not too many instructions competing for attention
- [ ] Related instructions grouped (not scattered)
- [ ] Low-priority content clearly marked or separated

---

# Layer 7: Testability Assessment

**Goal**: Evaluate whether compliance can be verified

## 7.1 Verifiable Instructions

### 7.1.1 Binary Verification

For each instruction, can we determine:

- [ ] Did the agent do it? (Yes/No, not subjective)

- [ ] Are there explicit "ask for help" triggers?

### 8.2.2 Hallucination Prevention

- [ ] Instructions require verification/citation
- [ ] Agent permitted to express uncertainty
- [ ] Speculative content clearly marked
- [ ] External tool use for factual queries

## 8.3 Iterative Compatibility

### 8.3.1 Refinement Support

### 8.3.2 Conversation Compatibility

- [ ] Works in multi-turn conversations
- [ ] Handles clarification requests
- [ ] Handles scope changes mid-task

---

# Layer 9: Improvement Synthesis

**Goal**: Consolidate findings into actionable improvements

## 9.1 Issue Prioritization

| Severity | Criteria | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **CRITICAL** | Blocks agent from completing task | Fix immediately |
| **HIGH** | Causes incorrect/inconsistent output | Fix before deployment |
| **MEDIUM** | Reduces quality or efficiency | Fix in next iteration |
| **LOW** | Minor improvement opportunity | Backlog |

### 9.1.2 Effort Classification

| Effort | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **TRIVIAL** | Single word/phrase change |
| **SMALL** | Single section rewrite |
| **MEDIUM** | Multiple section changes |
| **LARGE** | Document restructure |

# Execution Protocol

## Prerequisites

Before starting review:

- [ ] Full document text accessible
- [ ] Related documents available for cross-reference
- [ ] Understanding of document's purpose and context
- [ ] Access to example outputs (if available)

## Execution Order

Layers MUST be executed in order 1-9. Each layer builds on previous findings.

**Exit criteria**: Review is complete only when the output is produced using the required format AND the verification checklist is fully evaluated.

**Checkpointing**: After each layer, summarize findings before proceeding.

**Time Boxing**: Set time limits per layer based on document size:

**How to measure document size** (use line count):

```bash
wc -l path/to/document.md
```

| Document Size | Layer 1-3 | Layer 4-5 | Layer 6-8 | Layer 9 |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Small (<500 lines) | 10min | 15min | 15min | 10min |
| Medium (500-2000 lines) | 20min | 30min | 30min | 20min |
| Large (>2000 lines) | 30min | 45min | 45min | 30min |

**Rationale**: Time boxes prevent perfectionism paralysis and ensure progress. Layers 4-5 (completeness, anti-patterns) and 6-8 (context, testability, ergonomics) get more time as they require deeper analysis. Layer 9 synthesizes findings rather than discovering new ones, so needs less time. If a layer cannot be completed within its time box, note blocking issues and proceed — incomplete analysis is better than no analysis.

## Error Handling

### Partial Completion

If a layer cannot be fully completed:

1. **Document what was analyzed** — note which checklist items were completed
2. **Note blocking issues** — why couldn't the layer be completed (missing context, ambiguous scope, etc.)
3. **Mark as PARTIAL** — in output, indicate layer status as PARTIAL with reason
4. **Proceed to next layer** — don't block the entire review

### Missing Information

If required information is unavailable:

- **Dependencies not accessible**: Note as blocker, analyze what IS available
- **Examples not provided**: Flag in Layer 7 (Testability), suggest creating examples
- **Context unclear**: Ask user for clarification OR make assumptions explicit

### Recovery Protocol

If review must be interrupted (context compaction, session end):

1. Save current state to file: `review-checkpoint-{document}-{layer}.md`
2. Include: completed layers summary, current layer progress, issues found so far
3. On resume: read checkpoint, verify document unchanged, continue from saved layer

## Output Format

After completing all layers, produce:

```markdown
# Prompt Engineering Review: {Document Name}

## Summary
- **Document Type**: {type}
- **Overall Quality**: {GOOD|NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT|POOR}
- **Critical Issues**: {count}
- **Total Issues**: {count}

## Context Budget & Evidence
- **Budget**: {max files / max total lines/words OR summarize-and-drop policy}
- **Inputs loaded**: {path — size — sections/ranges}
- **Overflow handling**: {budget respected | fail-safe taken (what + why)}

## Layer Summaries
{One paragraph per layer}

## Issues Found

### Critical
| ID | Layer | Description | Location | Fix |
|----|-------|-------------|----------|-----|
| C1 | L5 | AP-VAGUE: No output format | Section 3.2 | Add format spec |

### High
{table}

### Medium
{table}

### Low
{table}

## Recommended Fixes

### Immediate (Critical/High + Low Effort)
1. {Fix description with before/after}

### Next Iteration (Medium Priority)
1. {Fix description}

### Backlog (Low Priority / High Effort)
1. {Fix description}

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] All critical issues addressed
- [ ] No new issues introduced
- [ ] Examples/tests updated if needed
- [ ] Context overflow prevented (budget + gating + chunking + summarization + fail-safe) with evidence
```

**N/A rule**: Only mark an item N/A if the document explicitly makes it inapplicable. Otherwise mark as FAIL or PARTIAL and describe what’s missing.
