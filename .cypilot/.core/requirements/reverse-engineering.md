## Agent Instructions

**ALWAYS open and follow**: This file WHEN user requests to analyze codebase, search in code, search in project documentation, or generate artifacts/code based on existing project structure

**ALWAYS open and follow**: `{cypilot_path}/.core/requirements/execution-protocol.md` for workflow context

**Prerequisite**: Agent confirms understanding before proceeding:
- [ ] Agent has read and understood this methodology
- [ ] Agent has access to source code repository
- [ ] Agent will execute layers in order 1-9
- [ ] Agent will checkpoint findings after each layer

---

## Overview

This methodology provides a systematic approach to understanding any software project through progressive layers of analysis. Each layer builds on the previous, creating a comprehensive mental model of the system.

**Core Principle**: Observe patterns, not technologies. Every project, regardless of stack, exhibits universal patterns in how it organizes code, handles data, manages state, and communicates between components.

---

## Analysis Layers

```
Layer 1: Surface Reconnaissance     → What does this project look like?
Layer 2: Entry Point Analysis       → Where does execution begin?
Layer 3: Structural Decomposition   → How is code organized?
Layer 4: Data Flow Tracing          → How does data move through the system?
Layer 5: Dependency Mapping         → What depends on what?
Layer 6: State Management Analysis  → How is state created, modified, persisted?
Layer 7: Integration Boundary Scan  → Where does the system touch the outside world?
Layer 8: Pattern Recognition        → What conventions and idioms are used?
Layer 9: Knowledge Synthesis        → What have we learned?
```

# Execution Protocol

## Prerequisites

Before starting reverse engineering:

- [ ] Access to source code repository
- [ ] Ability to search/grep codebase
- [ ] Read permissions for all directories
- [ ] (Optional) Ability to run the code locally
- [ ] (Optional) Access to running instance

## Execution Order

Layers MUST be executed in order 1-9. Each layer builds on previous findings.

**Checkpointing**: After each layer, summarize findings before proceeding.

**Time Boxing**: Set time limits per layer based on project size:

| Project Size | Layer 1-2 | Layer 3-4 | Layer 5-7 | Layer 8-9 |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Small (<10k LOC) | 15min | 30min | 30min | 15min |
| Medium (10k-100k) | 30min | 1hr | 1hr | 30min |
| Large (>100k) | 1hr | 2hr | 2hr | 1hr |

## Output Artifacts

After completing all layers, produce:

1. **System Overview** (1 page max)
   - Purpose, tech stack, architecture style
   - Key components and relationships

2. **Domain Model** (entities and relationships)

3. **Entry Points Catalog** (all ways to invoke the system)

4. **Integration Map** (external dependencies and boundaries)

5. **Conventions Guide** (naming, patterns, idioms)

6. **Technical Debt List** (issues and risks identified)

---

## Applicability

This methodology applies to:

- **Greenfield projects**: Validate understanding before implementation
- **Brownfield projects**: Understand before modification
- **Acquisitions/transfers**: Due diligence and onboarding
- **Legacy modernization**: Identify boundaries for strangler fig pattern
- **Documentation generation**: Input for Cypilot artifact creation

## Integration with Cypilot

This methodology feeds into Cypilot workflows:

- **Adapter workflow**: Uses Layer 1-3 for project scan
- **Generate workflow**: Uses all layers for artifact creation
- **Validate workflow**: Uses Layer 4-7 for traceability verification

---

## Error Handling

### Repository Access Failed

**If source code repository cannot be accessed**:
```
⚠️ Repository access failed: {error}
→ Check file permissions
→ Verify path exists
→ Confirm VCS (git) is accessible
```
**Action**: STOP — cannot analyze without source access.

### Layer Incomplete

**If a layer cannot be fully completed**:
```
⚠️ Layer {N} incomplete: {reason}
→ Completed: {list of completed items}
→ Skipped: {list of skipped items}
→ Reason: {blocking issue}
```
**Action**: Document gaps explicitly, proceed to next layer with caveat.

### External Dependencies Unavailable

**If external services/dependencies cannot be inspected**:
```
⚠️ External dependency unavailable: {service}
→ Cannot verify: integration patterns, authentication, data formats
→ Marking integration boundary as UNVERIFIED
```
**Action**: WARN and continue — document as knowledge gap.

### Large Codebase Timeout

**If analysis exceeds time box for layer**:
```
⚠️ Time box exceeded for Layer {N}
→ Completed: {percentage}% of checklist items
→ Save checkpoint and resume later OR
→ Proceed with partial findings (document gaps)
```
**Action**: Save checkpoint, note incompleteness, proceed to next layer.

### Obfuscated or Generated Code

**If significant portions are obfuscated/generated**:
```
⚠️ Obfuscated/generated code detected: {location}
→ Skipping detailed analysis of generated files
→ Focusing on source templates/generators instead
```
**Action**: Analyze generators/templates, not generated output.
